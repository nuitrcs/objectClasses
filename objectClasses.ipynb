    "### <br><br>Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "Now that you know the basics for creating your own objects, you might be thinking about how you can apply it to your own code. Setting up object classes and their rules first, and then having them interact, is a style of coding called Object Oriented Programming. If you took the Python Fundamentals three-day workshop with me, we focused on more of a \"procedural\" style of coding - working from the top of the code to the bottom and emphasizing logic and loops. Both styles work well in Python. We could have taken a more procedural approach to create the Fantasy Orchestra league by using dictionaries, loops, and if/then statements.\n",
    "<br><br>There is an episode of the children's show, Bluey, that really reflects the style of Object Oriented Programming. In Season 1, Episode 23 - Shops - a group of kids are playing pretend. One kid just wants to start, but another kid wants to lay out all the rules first: Who will be the shopkeeper? Who will be the customer? What does the shop sell? What will the customer buy? What will be used for money? By the time everything is decided and they finally play, it only takes about ten seconds to play out the scenario! This is classic object oriented programming. \n",
    "<br><br>We didn't have time to get to this today, but Object Classes can be reused in other code, and within your notebook you can create a new object class that inherits the attributes and methods from a Parent class, so you don't need to retype all that code and can specify small changes.\n",
    "<br><br>If you're creating objects and setting their rules and then simulating situations that might result, that is called Agent Based Modeling - we plan to have a workshop on that next year!"
